Info
----------------------
The following files are for performing molecular static simulations along with polarisation calculations of rhombohedral barium titante at 0K using the 
Isotropic-anharmonic Shell Model proposed by Vielma and Schneider based on PBEsol exchange-correlation functional. within changing Electric field. The polarization will change as magnectic curve within changing electric field.
